1. Arrays & Strings

- Two pointer problems – reversing string in place
- Sliding window problems – longest substring

2. HashMaps & HashSets

- Fast lookup structures
- Check duplicates
- Count frequencies
- Constant time lookup
- Two sum
- Group anagrams
- Top k frequent elements

3. Stacks and Queues

- Order and timing
- Backtracking problems, checking for valid parentheses, evaluating notations
- Processing items in order and BFS
- Binary search – first or last position of an element

4. Recursion

- Exploring possibilities, generating subsets, solving n-queens, navigating mazes

5. Trees and BSTs

- Traversal, lowest common ancestor, checking balance, inorder traversal

6. Heaps

- Min heaps, max heaps, priority queues
- Keep track of the top k elements, like in streaming data or scheduling problems
- For problems of returning k largest numbers

7. Graphs

- Courses, prerequisites, island finding
- BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm
- Shortest path
