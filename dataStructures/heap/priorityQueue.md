# Priority Queue

Abstract data structure where elements have associated priorities. Higher priority elements are served before lower priority ones, regardless of insertion order.

## Key Features

- **Priority-based ordering** (not FIFO)
- **Dynamic priority management**
- **Efficient access** to highest/lowest priority element
- **Multiple implementations** (heaps, arrays, linked lists)

## Common Use Cases

- **OS Scheduling**: Process prioritization
- **Algorithms**: Dijkstra's, Prim's
- **Emergency Systems**: Hospital triage
- **Network Management**: QoS traffic handling
- **Game Development**: AI decision making
