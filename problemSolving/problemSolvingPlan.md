# Problem-Solving Plan

---

## Steps for Solving Problems

1. **Understand the problem**
2. **Explore concrete examples**
3. **Break it down**
4. **Solve or simplify**
5. **Look back and refactor**

---

### 1. Understand the Problem

- Restate the problem in your own words
- Identify inputs and outputs
- Determine if outputs can be derived from inputs
- Name important data pieces and terminology

---

### 2. Explore Examples

- Create example cases (simple, complex, edge cases)
- Use as sanity checks and unit tests

---

### 3. Break It Down

- Outline explicit steps to solve the problem
- Use comments to plan before coding

---

### 4. Solve or Simplify

- If stuck, solve a simpler version first
- Focus on core logic, then handle edge cases

---

### 5. Look Back and Refactor

- Review and test your solution
- Refactor for readability and efficiency
- Consider alternative approaches
- Write tests to validate and prevent regressions
