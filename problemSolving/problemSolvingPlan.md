## 1. Devise a Plan for Solving Problems

### Plan Overview

1. Understand the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve or simplify
5. Look back and refactor

### 1.1 Understand the Problem

Ask yourself the following questions:

- **Can you restate the problem in your own words?**
- **What are the inputs?**
- **What are the outputs? How should they look?**
- **Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?** Is there enough information, or is anything else required?
- **How should you name important pieces of data?** What terminology should you use?

---

### 1.2 Explore Examples

- **Come up with example cases** to better understand the problem.
  - Use these examples as sanity checks for the eventual solution.
  - Examples can be user stories or unit tests.
- **Start with simple examples** and write them down.
- **Progress to more complex examples and edge cases**, such as empty or invalid inputs.

---

### 1.3 Break It Down

- Note an explicit sequence of steps needed to solve the problem.
- Use comments to outline these steps, which can later be replaced with actual code.

---

### 1.4 Solve or Simplify

- If you can't solve the problem immediately, try to simplify it.
  - Solve a simpler version of the problem first, then build upon it.
  - Ignore edge cases initially and focus on the core logic.
- Once the core logic works, handle edge cases and refine the solution.

---

### 1.5 Look Back and Refactor

- Review your solution to ensure it works for all cases, including edge cases.
- Refactor the code to improve readability, efficiency, or maintainability.
- Consider if there are alternative approaches that might be better.
- Write tests to validate the solution and prevent future regressions.
