## 2. Master Common Problem-Solving Patterns

Popular problem patterns:

- Frequency Counter
- Multiple Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- Many, many more

### Frequency Counter

- Use JavaScript objects to group values and their frequencies in the given input(s).
- This approach often avoids nested loops and can achieve a time complexity of O(n).
- Example: Refer to the `same` function in the `same.js` file or to the `validAnagram` function in the `validAnagram.js` file
